    <td colspan="6"><p class="style3">Complaints are a valuable source of feedback to  improve the infrastructure and condition of our city. The citizens may have  complaints with respect to their environment and city`s infrastructure but they  might not like the traditional complaining system in which they have to undergo  a long procedure like going to the office and standing there for hours in  queue, wasting so much of their valuable time and efforts. So, to gap the  bridge, we came up with an online application introducing a new platform for  sharing problems between civil service authorities and the public just in two  clicks which can be easily used by the citizens in an optimal manner keeping  them unaware of the background processes and details. The proposed project facilitates the complete citizen facilitation  process with the effective information gathering. The website is also maintains  the basic details of each ward such as, ward number, total citizens, available  facilities like schools, library, post office, cooperative bank and its  address. So anyone can view their particular area details from anywhere and can  able to raise a compliant. To facilitate this complaining procedure, we  are going to implement an online web application that lets citizens report  problems with infrastructure in their city to relevant authority. </p>
